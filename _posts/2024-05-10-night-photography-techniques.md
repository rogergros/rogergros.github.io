Night photography opens up a world of creative possibilities that simply don't exist during daylight hours. From the twinkling lights of city skylines to the ethereal glow of the Milky Way, night photography allows us to capture scenes with a unique atmosphere and mood that can't be replicated in bright light.

## Understanding Night Photography

### What Makes Night Photography Special
- **Unique lighting**: Artificial lights create dramatic contrasts and colors
- **Long exposures**: Capture movement and light trails over time
- **Atmospheric conditions**: Fog, mist, and weather add mood
- **Color temperature**: Different light sources create varied color casts

### Challenges of Night Photography
- **Low light**: Requires longer exposures and higher ISO settings
- **Focus difficulties**: Limited light makes autofocus challenging
- **Camera shake**: Long exposures are sensitive to movement
- **Noise**: High ISO settings can introduce digital noise

## Essential Equipment

### Camera Requirements
- **Manual controls**: Full control over aperture, shutter speed, and ISO
- **High ISO performance**: Good low-light capability
- **Bulb mode**: For exposures longer than 30 seconds
- **Live view**: Helpful for focusing and composition

### Lens Selection
- **Fast lenses**: f/2.8 or faster for maximum light gathering
- **Wide angle**: 16-35mm for cityscapes and landscapes
- **Standard zoom**: 24-70mm for general night photography
- **Prime lenses**: Maximum aperture and sharpness

### Essential Accessories
- **Sturdy tripod**: Essential for sharp long exposures
- **Remote release**: Prevent camera shake during exposure
- **Extra batteries**: Cold weather drains batteries quickly

- **Focus**: Manual focus for precise control
- **White balance**: Custom or appropriate preset

### Exposure Techniques
- **Manual mode**: Full control over all settings
- **Exposure bracketing**: Capture multiple exposures for safety
- **Histogram reading**: Ensure proper exposure distribution
- **Test shots**: Take multiple exposures to find the right settings

### Focus Strategies
- **Manual focus**: Use live view and magnification
- **Hyperfocal distance**: Maximize depth of field
- **Focus stacking**: Combine multiple focused images
- **Infinity focus**: For distant subjects like stars

## Lighting in Night Photography
