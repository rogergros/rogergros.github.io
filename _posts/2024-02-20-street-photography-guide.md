Street photography is about capturing authentic moments of everyday life. It's a challenging but rewarding genre that requires quick thinking, technical skill, and a keen eye for human behavior.

## Essential Equipment

### Camera Choice
- **DSLR/Mirrorless**: For high-quality images and manual control
- **Compact cameras**: For discretion and portability
- **Smartphones**: For spontaneous moments and social sharing
- **Film cameras**: For classic aesthetics and slower, more deliberate approach

### Lens Selection
- **Wide-angle (24-35mm)**: For environmental portraits and street scenes
- **Standard (50mm)**: For natural perspective and versatility
- **Telephoto (85-200mm)**: For candid shots from a distance
- **Prime lenses**: For faster apertures and better image quality

## Technical Considerations

### Camera Settings
- **Aperture priority**: Control depth of field for creative effects
- **Shutter speed**: Freeze motion or create intentional blur
- **ISO**: Balance light sensitivity with image quality
- **Focus**: Use zone focusing for quick response

### Lighting
- **Natural light**: Work with available lighting conditions
- **Shadows**: Use contrast for dramatic effect
- **Reflections**: Incorporate reflective surfaces creatively
- **Weather**: Embrace different atmospheric conditions

## Ethical Considerations

Street photography involves photographing people in public spaces:

- **Respect privacy**: Be mindful of personal boundaries
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Understand local customs and norms
- **Legal awareness**: Know your rights and local laws
- **Consent**: Consider asking permission when appropriate

## Creative Techniques

### Storytelling
- Look for narrative moments
- Capture emotional expressions
- Show relationships between people
- Include environmental context

### Composition
- Use urban geometry and patterns
- Incorporate reflections and shadows
- Frame subjects through windows or doorways
- Create layers of visual interest

## Post-Processing

Enhance your street photography:

- **Black and white conversion** for timeless appeal
- **Contrast adjustment** to emphasize mood
- **Selective cropping** to strengthen composition
- **Minimal editing** to maintain authenticity

Street photography is about seeing the extraordinary in ordinary moments. The key is to be present, observant, and ready to capture life as it unfolds.
