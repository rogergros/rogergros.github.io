In our hyperconnected world, the line between work and personal life has become increasingly blurred. With smartphones, laptops, and constant notifications, it's easier than ever to be "always on" and harder than ever to truly disconnect. Finding a sustainable work-life balance has become one of the most important challenges of modern life.

## The Modern Challenge

The traditional 9-to-5 workday has evolved into something much more fluid. Many of us check emails before bed, respond to work messages on weekends, and feel guilty when we're not being productive. This constant connectivity can lead to burnout, stress, and a diminished quality of life.

## Why Work-Life Balance Matters
