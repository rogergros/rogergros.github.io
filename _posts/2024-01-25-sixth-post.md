This is the sixth post in our blog series. I've been working on this Jekyll site for a while now, and it's been quite an interesting journey learning about static site generators and how they work. The [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) has been incredibly helpful throughout this process, and I've also found some great resources on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deployment. The combination of these tools makes it really easy to create a beautiful, fast website that's easy to maintain and update.
