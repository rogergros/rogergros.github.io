This post demonstrates the responsive design features of our custom template.

## Mobile-First Design

The template is built with a mobile-first approach:

- **Flexible navigation** that stacks on mobile
- **Responsive typography** that scales appropriately
- **Touch-friendly** buttons and links
- **Optimized spacing** for different screen sizes

## Testing Responsiveness

Try resizing your browser window to see how the layout adapts:

1. **Desktop**: Full navigation bar with horizontal layout
2. **Tablet**: Adjusted font sizes and spacing
3. **Mobile**: Stacked navigation and optimized typography

## Blockquotes

Here's how blockquotes look with the custom styling:

The design maintains readability across all devices while keeping the minimalistic aesthetic.
