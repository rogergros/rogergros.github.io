This is the third post in our series. As you can see, the posts are displayed in chronological order on the homepage.

## About the Design

The design features a minimalistic approach with:

- **Dark background** for reduced eye strain
- **Large, readable fonts** for better accessibility
- **Pastel link colors** that are easy to change
- **Clean typography** with proper spacing

## Customization

To change the link color, simply edit the `$link-color` variable in `assets/main.scss`:

```scss
$link-color: #a8d5ba; // Change this to any pastel color you like
```

Some other pastel options:
- `#ffb3ba` (pastel pink)
- `#baffc9` (pastel green)
- `#bae1ff` (pastel blue)
- `#ffffba` (pastel yellow)
