# Welcome to Your Jekyll Site

This is a basic Jekyll site compatible with GitHub Pages. You can start customizing it by:

1. Editing the `_config.yml` file to change site settings
2. Modifying this `index.md` file to update your homepage
3. Adding new pages in the root directory
4. Creating blog posts in the `_posts` directory

## Getting Started

To run this site locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4000` to see your site.
